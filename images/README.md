# Screenshots

Add your screenshots here:

1. **screenshot1.png** - Main feature showing grouped references
   - Recommended size: 800x600 or larger
   - Show the bottom panel with Writes/Reads groups expanded

2. **panel-view.png** - Close-up of the panel
   - Show clear example with code snippets visible

3. **demo.gif** (optional) - Animated demo
   - Show the process: right-click → find references → panel opens

## Tips for good screenshots:
- Use a clean, readable theme (Dark+ or Light+)
- Make sure font size is readable (13px+)
- Show meaningful code examples
- Capture the whole bottom panel with tabs visible

## How to take screenshots:
1. Open VSCode with the extension running
2. Find references on a variable (like 'counter' in test-example.ts)
3. Press Win+Shift+S (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+4 (Mac)
4. Save as PNG in this folder

After adding screenshots, they will automatically be included in the extension package.
